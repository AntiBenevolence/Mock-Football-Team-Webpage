# Mock-Football-Team-Webpage

This project aims to showcase my skills in web design by creating a fully functional mock webpage for a fictional football team. Through this project, I intend to demonstrate my proficiency in UI/UX design, HTML, CSS, and potentially other web technologies. The mock webpage will encompass various sections such as team information, player profiles, match schedules, news updates, and more, providing an immersive experience for users who visit the webpage.

By undertaking this project, I aim to highlight my ability to create visually appealing and interactive web interfaces while adhering to modern design principles. 
Feel free to explore the project files to see how I've brought together design elements, layout structures, and interactivity to craft a captivating mock webpage for the football team.
